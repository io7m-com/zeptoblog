Been experimenting with independent
[module](/glossary.xhtml#module) versioning by developing an
[OSGi IRC bot](https://www.github.com/io7m-com/thoth/). The idea is to
expose any deficiencies in tools when modules within a single
[Maven](/glossary.xhtml#maven) project have different version numbers.

Initial indications are good!

One serious issue is that with independent versions, sooner or later
there's going to be a release of the project where one or more modules
haven't been updated and will therefore have the same version numbers
as existing already-deployed modules. It's therefore going to be
necessary to work out how to prevent Maven deploying bundles that
already exist. Apparently, [Charles Honton](http://www.mail-archive.com/users@maven.apache.org/msg139206.html)
has a plugin for this.

Conceptually, moving to independently versioned modules means that a
given _project version_ now describes _a set of module versions_ as
opposed to simply defining a single version for all modules. I might
rewrite [changelog](https://www.github.com/io7m-com/changelog) to better fit
with this fundamental conceptual change.
